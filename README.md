# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

Created a webpage using the prework guide in order to organize all future Bootcamp notes. This webpage serves as a place keep track of my work progress in how I am able to improve through my Bootcamp journey. Hopefully, this webpage can help with keeping ontop of my learning as well as reduce the information overload I may face at times. To begin with, I have learned to use HTML, CSS, Git as well a JavaScript. 

## Installation

## Usage

There are four topics covering HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. Within each section, there are notes about that topic. If we open the DevTools console, we can see the JavaScript running which displays the topics which we learned from the prework and chooses one topic at random for us to study first.
